# Challenge_1_AP - HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
In this challenge, we were given a code base from a marketing agency with the primary aim of refactoring the code to improve functionality (i.e. - fix broken links) and follow accessibility standards to ensure that people with certain disabilities can access the website using assistive web technologies.  To do this, I first reviewed the code and refactored by adding appropriate semantic HTML tags and consolidating repetitive CSS code across sections that had the same styling applied to them.  More about my refactoring logic can be found commented within the HTML and CSS Style sheet in my Challenge 1 repo.
